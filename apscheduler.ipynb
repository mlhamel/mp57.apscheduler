    "For the uninitiated, APScheduler is a task scheduling and management system written in Python. Thinking of it as a cron/at daemon running inside your application is not far off, but APScheduler also provides management and monitoring of jobs, and much more. And of course it runs Python code instead of shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one were to compare APScheduler with Celery, the difference could be summarized like this: Celery is a distributed task queue with basic scheduling capabilities, while APScheduler is a full featured scheduler with basic task queuing capabilities. Users tell me that APScheduler is easier to set up. I haven't personally used Celery, so I can't comment on that.\n",

    "...\n",
